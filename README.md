# Punnya

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. (Just build main.dart file in lib folder)


Problem Statement- NGOs are established with a vision by a group of like-minded people committed to community development, and uplifting of poor people. But, nowadays, many NGOs in India are facing various problems and challenges which are creating barriers to the implementation of various developmental programs like poor governance, absence of strategic planning, and poor networking and communication mechanisms.

Solution - The ubiquity(use ) of smartphones and tablets has made it convenient for users to engage in fundraising activities and awaken their social conscience with donation apps. Apart from convenience and ease of use, such applications are free to download and use. Keeping this in mind, we have built the app  “ Punya “ where we have accumulated different Ngo information along with many useful features. Our app is increasing the connectivity between people and NGOs by bringing them together in one place. Not only users but different NGOs can post and showcase their campaigns and motives through our community channel and may work together in the future. We have added a Donation portal, location links, and contact info for better communication and are planning to add an appointment facility directly with the NGOs.
